# cppShoppingList
Module 1, individual learning.

# Overview

This software creates and displays a shopping list of items for a user to bring with them to the store.
It holds information such as location and quantity, and calculates the total price for all items.

I wrote this sofware as my first ever C++ project, in hopes to gain a better understanding of C++ and its abilities.

# Future Work

* Have the software sort the shopping list by department of store. 
* Display one item on the list at a time, so that the user can move with the list in the store.
* Enable user to "check off" items from the shopping list.
* Enable getline for two word item names and locations.
